# pythonSmallExercises
**This repository contains some small projects in python.**
## "Requests" from the internet.
1. ***exercise1.py*** (easy): Write a Python program to display the current date and time.
2. ***exercise2.py*** (easy): Write a Python program to print all even numbers from a given numbers list in the same order and stop the printing if any numbers that come after 237 in the sequence. 
3. ***exercise3.py*** (easy):

## My ideas 
1. ***idea1.py*** : Python program that comments given text on istagram post. 
Note: I used pyautogui library so i can use functions like  **pyautogui.press** and **pyautogui.dragTo** that provide me keyboard functions.
-This program is used only for educational purposes-
**idea1.py (file)**: the idea1.py uses a file named instagram_comments.txt, which contains lines that will be printed.




## exercise1_Notes: 
I used libraries such as **datetime** for the current date information and **tkinter** so i can print my message through a window.
